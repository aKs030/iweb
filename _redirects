# Cloudflare Pages / Netlify style redirects
# Purpose: canonicalize folder URLs, remove index.html and .html endings where desired

# -------------------------------
# 1) Domain + protocol canonicalization
# NOTE: Cloudflare Pages doesn't support absolute URLs in _redirects.
# Domain redirects should be handled via DNS/page rules or removed if handled elsewhere.
# Removed absolute URL redirects as they're not supported by Cloudflare Pages.

# -------------------------------
# 2) Specific 301 redirects (keep these before any generic rules)

# Remove explicit index.html mappings (canonical trailing-slash roots)
/index.html          /              301
/blog/index.html     /blog/         301
/projekte/index.html /projekte/     301
/gallery/index.html  /gallery/      301
/videos/index.html   /videos/       301

# Redirect old file locations to new clean URLs
/pages/gallery/gallery.html     /gallery/     301
/pages/projekte/projekte.html   /projekte/    301
/pages/videos/videos.html       /videos/      301

# Redirect legacy/internal component URLs to canonical public pages
/content/components/footer/datenschutz.html    /datenschutz/ 301
/content/components/footer/impressum.html       /impressum/   301
/content/components/footer/datenschutz         /datenschutz/ 301
/content/components/footer/impressum           /impressum/   301
/content/footer/datenschutz                     /datenschutz/ 301
/content/footer/impressum                       /impressum/   301

# -------------------------------
# 3) Generic cleanups
# Remove any remaining ".html" endings and canonicalize to trailing-slash roots.
# Keep this after specific redirects so we don't accidentally override them.

# Don't redirect .html in /pages/ as they are loaded dynamically
# Ensure any requests under /pages/ are rewritten to the physical folder
# so dynamic XHR requests (e.g. /pages/home/hero.html) are served directly
/pages/*         /pages/:splat         200
/pages/*.html    /pages/:splat.html    200

/*.html   /:splat/   301

# Ensure root section names without trailing slash are redirected to the slash version
/about    /about/     301
/blog     /blog/      301
/gallery  /gallery/   301
/projekte /projekte/  301
/videos   /videos/    301

# -------------------------------
# 4) Rewrites to serve content from the physical /pages/ folders
# These are 200 rewrites so clean URLs map to their actual files under /pages/.
# Removed root redirects that were causing infinite loops - the wildcard rules handle everything
/gallery/*      /pages/gallery/:splat     200
/projekte/*     /pages/projekte/:splat    200
/videos/*       /pages/videos/:splat      200
/blog/*         /pages/blog/:splat        200
/about/*        /pages/about/:splat       200

# -------------------------------
# Notes / rationale:
# - Specific redirects come first to avoid conflicts with the generic ".html" rule.
# - The generic rule redirects any ".html" URL to the same path with a trailing slash.
#   This covers both top-level pages like /about.html -> /about/ and deeper paths.
# - We also add short redirects so requests to e.g. /about (no slash) get a canonical
#   trailing-slash URL to match how directories are served.
# - Removed absolute URL redirects as Cloudflare Pages doesn't support them.
# - Removed root 200 rewrites that were causing infinite loops with .html removal rules.
# - Test after deploy: check a sample of old URLs, ".html" URLs and domain variants to
#   ensure there are no redirect loops and that final destinations return 200.
